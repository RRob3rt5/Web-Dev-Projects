    <center><p>My name is Ryan Roberts and I'm an undergraduate at the University of Montana,
       currently achieving a bachelors degree in Wildlife Biology. I enjoy playing guitar,
       lifting weights and hiking. I still have not figured out what I want to do
       after I graduate but I have enjoyed taking web design and photoshop courses
       to learn about different opportunities.

    <center><p>I was inspired to do this project on how to make peanutbutter
      and jelly sandwiches because I love food, and PB&J
      sandwiches have always had an infleunce on me growing up. I find that
      with most people, PB&J sandwiches have incorporated themselves into
      people's lives at some point. While some may think its not
      difficult to screw up a PB&J, you'd be very surprised. Although, the beauty
      behind the art of making these sandwiches is through personal
      preferences and tastes. One can make this sandwhich very unique based on
      what they enjoy or what kind of mood they are in. Whether that may
      be changing the ratio of PB to jelly; incorporating Nutella or honey;
      and even the simple extra step to toast the bread beforehand; making a
      peanutbutter and jelly sandwhich can be an artistic masterpiecee.
