# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Ryan Roberts
I decided to take this class because I needed an elective to fulfull graduation requirements. But I also thought it would be a really good skill to learn and be able to apply it to jobs in the future.

But What exactly is the Internet? What I learned was:
+ The internet isn't controlled by anyone.
+ Conceptually, the internet was something we use everyday but never question where it came from or who invented it.
+ The internet was a research project with the Department of Defense with the idea of creating a communication system that would survive a nuclear attack.
