# Assignment 8 Repo
The difference between padding margin and borders is that padding is the amount of space between what's inside the element and the element itself. Margins are the space between the box or element and other elements. Finally, borders are lines that separate the content of the element from other elements and keep them contained; it makes the content look more organized and neater.

The most difficult task for me initially was positioning the elements. Trying to understand what each meant and how I wanted to organize the information. But after some trial and conceptual review it made more sense and I was able to create the product I have now.

I didn't have too much trouble with this assignment, the directions and help on the website were very useful and made a lot of sense. The hardest part initially was figuring out a way to lay out all of the information but after that was figured out it was smooth sailing throughout the process.
